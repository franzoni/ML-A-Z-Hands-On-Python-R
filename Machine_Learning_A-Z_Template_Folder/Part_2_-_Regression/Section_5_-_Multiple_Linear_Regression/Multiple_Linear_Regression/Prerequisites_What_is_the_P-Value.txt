Hi guys,

before we get into Backward Elimination, make sure to be introduced to the p-value and have a basic understanding of how it works. By looking at almost all the explanations of the p-value on the internet, we have selected for you the two best ones:

Explanation 1
	https://www.mathbootcamps.com/what-is-a-p-value/

Explanation 2
	https://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-P-Value

If you don't know what a p-value is, we recommend that you have a look at one of these explanations.

Kind regards,

Kirill & Hadelin
