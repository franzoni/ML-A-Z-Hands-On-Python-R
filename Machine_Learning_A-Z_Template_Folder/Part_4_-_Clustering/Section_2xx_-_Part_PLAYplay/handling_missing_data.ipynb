    "\n",
    "While R contains four basic data types, NumPy supports far more than this: for example, while R has a single integer type, NumPy supports fourteen basic integer types once you account for available precisions, signedness, and endianness of the encoding. Reserving a specific bit pattern in all available NumPy types would lead to an unwieldy amount of overhead in special-casing various operations for various types, likely even requiring a new fork of the NumPy package. Further, for the smaller data types (such as 8-bit integers), sacrificing a bit to use as a mask will significantly reduce the range of values it can represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NumPy does have support for masked arrays** – that is, arrays that have a separate Boolean mask array attached for marking data as \"good\" or \"bad.\" Pandas could have derived from this, but the overhead in both storage, computation, and code maintenance makes that an unattractive choice."
